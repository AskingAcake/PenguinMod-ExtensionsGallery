# Paint Utils
***Please ignore the spellings in the extension and this documentation of it. I get that it is not conformed to American spelling.***
Paint Utils is a PenguinMod extension made for colour theory. Colour theory describes the behavior of colour in the form of colour mixing among other things.

## Available Colours
**Before we get onto the blocks, we have to know what colours are available in the extension.**

Currently, the extension only supports a small amount of colours with no tints, tones, or shades. This will change in future updates.
Here are the colours in question with their position in the colour hierarchy in brackets:
